# Iyzico Datathon 

This repository contains our team's approach, implementations, and observations for the Iyzico Datathon. In this datathon, we were provided with data on merchants and their payment counts for months, and our task was to predict the payment counts for the last 3 months of 2023.

## Notebook Usage and Experimentation

You are free to use and share this notebook without needing permission. If dataset readings fail, you may need to update the `DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING` variable in the Initialization section with a more up-to-date dataset. Otherwise, you can utilize the `perform_regression` function to observe merchant behavior. Make sure to review the function's parameters to fully engage with it.
